      "Let us dive into the Word: A Bible study manual for a closer walk with God",
    description:
      "The Scripture says, “Study to show yourself approve unto God (1 Timothy 2:15).” Several events going on in our time are a wake-up call for us to dig deeper into the word of God and get more intimate with God. This Bible study manual is the work of the Holy Spirit. We commended it to you for your spiritual nourishment. As you use this manual, let the Holy Spirit lead and guide you and explain every detail to you. Have your Bible with you because you will need it. Read every Scriptural verse, meditate on it and let the Holy Spirit give you the interpretation. Although if you are doing speed-reading, you may be able to read through this manual quickly, you may not derive maximum benefits from it. Allow every part of it to sink into your heart and apply what the Holy Spirit teaches you. Prayerfully engage this manual. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
