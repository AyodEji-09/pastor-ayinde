    title: "Exploring The Multidimensional Mercies Of God",
    description:
      "Amid trials, confusions, and overwhelming issues of life, God gives urgent attention to a class of prayer: mercy prayer. We desire peace, prosperity, and all-around establishment in our lives, homes, families, professions, institutions, ministries, and nations. We receive all these on the platform of God’s mercies. Exploring The Multidimensional Mercies Of God is a handbook on God’s mercies. Each chapter is succinctly written to give illumination on a dimension of God's mercy and to spur up the passion in the reader to pray with the accompanying prayers that end the chapter. This book is divided into three sections. Section 1, What the mercies of God do, describes some benefits we can receive as a result of God’s mercies. Section 2, Grabbing hold of the mercies of God, describes the way Almighty God delights in showing endless mercies and how we can keep the rivers of His mercies continuously flowing in our lives. Sections 3, Be wise with the mercies of God, explains ways we can misuse the mercies of God, and how to be on guard against such things.",

    title: "Let The Lord Be Magnified",
    description:
      "Challenges of life show up disproportionately bigger than what they are. They are magnified to give us false impression that we are in for doom and gloom. They pose as if they are the biggest, toughest, strongest – and above all, insurmountable. They aim at creating disruption, disturbance, distress and ultimately, destruction. Some people cave in and are crushed by the trials, hardship and torrents of difficulties. But a rare few were able to weather the storms of life and emerged victorious. What makes the difference? Who and what is magnified amid choking circumstances determine how we will come out at the other end, whether battered and tattered or victorious and glorious. Let The Lord Be Magnified is a step-by-step explanation of Psalm 34:27. Among others, we will learn what it means to 'shout for joy'. Also, we will see various implications of 'Let the Lord be magnified.' God delights in our prosperity. We must magnify Him above whatever we are going through because He is the Creator of all things, and nothing catches Him unaware. We will see from the pages of this book that as we favor His righteous cause and we are bent on magnifying the Lord above the false magnification that challenges pose to us, God will come through for us; the challenges will give way; and we will emerge more-than-conquerors.",

      "On our journey to achieving excellence, we will encounter several challenges. Although God might not be the author of our challenges, they do not catch him off-guard. He uses them to build, train and equip us for the journey ahead. However, Satan wants the challenges to serve the opposite functions: steal from us, kill us, destroy the purposes of God for our lives, and hinder us from making progress. God is aware of our challenges. Nevertheless, He wants us to be the epitome of excellence. God is excellent in all His ways. He created us in His image. He has instilled his excellent nature in us at creation to spur us to excellence. The purpose of this book is to encourage us to strive for excellence. In it, we will encounter various factors that impede excellence and the way out of them. Also, we will uncover various factors that guarantee excellence in all our endeavors and how to stay true to them.",

    title: "Revival Songs, volume 2",
    description:
      "I am increasingly desperate for more of God, more of His power, fire, and glory. I am yearning for the mightiest move of the Holy Spirit, in my life, the Church, and throughout the world. I pray that the word of God will pierce my heart like a hammer, fire, and sword, awakening me to greater works and quickening me for God's higher calling in Christ Jesus. I feel like I am lacking in my spiritual life and don't have enough of God's power to do mighty exploits. This has left me feeling empty and in need of more of God. When I compare my contributions to the Body of Christ with what is expected of me, I realize that I am bankrupt and nowhere to be found. I think there are some moves of God in my days in some lives and gatherings. However, there remains a dissatisfaction within me regarding the spiritual reality, status, and stature of the general assembly of the Body of Christ. It would be irresponsible of me to simply criticize and blame others without offering productive solutions. After all, what good has come from finger-pointing and blaming others? The fire of Hell is not saying enough of the casualties that are trooping into its eternal damnation. The grave is not saying enough of the Christless populace it welcomes regularly. The womb of wickedness is not saying enough of the unscriptural inventions it is conceiving and bringing forth. I cannot afford to be grossly irresponsible. I must be freshly baptized with the fire of God. I must carry the power of the Holy Spirit without measure for the global Kingdom assignment. I must trust the Lord that in His mercies, He would use me to bring down revival which will be growing stronger in all generations until Rapture. Out of this necessity and my spiritual emptiness, the Holy Spirit inspired me to write songs of revival. It's in the nature of the Holy Spirit to use the weak and foolish things of this world to shame the strong and wise. That's why He chose to use me to write Revival Songs, Volume 2. All glory goes to Him! Each of the songs in this book has a unique tune. Some of the tunes were newly inspired by Him, while others were already existing tunes used to convey the message of His revival. In such cases, we indicate 'To the tune of.' We send out this book through the power of the Holy Spirit, and we pray that wherever these songs are sung, the Lord will bring about His mightiest revival. We ask this in Jesus' Name. Amen!",

    description:
      "We live in a time when the wrong is paraded as right and the right is paraded as wrong. An alternative lifestyle is gaining ground. Political correctness is beclouding the mind of the naive and strange knowledge is becoming rampant. Come to think about it: How would the coming generations perceive the concept of moral and ethics in the world that is gravitating speedily in the direction of moral depravity and sensuality? As the light of the world, we are obliged to wield scriptural influence in the direction of holiness, righteousness, and purity. As the salt of the earth, our responsibility is to preserve this world from rottenness. Set An Example is a step-by-step explanation of 1 Timothy 4:12. To guide against despising, we must have an unshakable understanding of who we are in God. To preserve the authenticity of the word of God, the Lord is calling each of us to set the biblical example for believers in the key areas which determine the spiritual and moral states of the society: in speech, in life, in love, in faith and purity. Every believer who excels in setting an example in these core areas would have made a significant impact in this world; gladden the heart of God; and left a great legacy for generations.",

      "On the journey to fulfilling the purpose of God for your life, you cannot say that you have arrived. Read this slowly: “Now [God]…is able to…carry out His purpose and…do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think…infinitely beyond our greatest prayers, hopes, or dreams…according to His power that is at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20 AMP, emphasis mine). Read that at least three times. God’s infinite power at work in you gives you the space of operation and manifestation of infinite dimensions.

    description:
      "The Lord Jesus Christ asks us to pray that the will of God would be done on earth as it is done in heaven (Matthew 6:9-10). For the will of God to be done on earth, His will must be done in your life, since you are one of the people on earth. The Apostle Paul admonished us not to be foolish but understand what the will of the Lord is (Ephesians 5:17). The will of God for your life is that you fulfill His purpose for your life, the reason you were born. Wisdom is the opposite of folly. So, you are wise when you understand the will of God for your life, and this converges to you discovering, understanding, and fulfilling His purpose for your life. The Father’s heart desire is that you will channel your efforts, intellects—all your resources—to becoming who He created you to be, in His determinate counsel.The Lord Jesus Christ said that His priority is to fulfill His purpose on earth, which is summed up in the salvation of humanity from the dominion of sin, Satan, and the world. Similarly, your mind cannot contain the extent of the impacts you can make and lives you can touch if you surrender to the Lord and fulfill His purpose for your life. The opposite of this would be to live your life as you like, and this is a definition of a waste of your precious life. You must make a deliberate effort to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life.The purpose of this book is to ignite that unquenchable passion in you to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life, with eternity in view. It is not too early to do this. Neither is it too late. This matter requires a sense of urgency; you should take it as such.This title is in volumes.

      "You are not here by accident. Whether you were born inside or outside of wedlock is not a matter here at all. Even if the process that led to your pregnancy is called a “mistake,” that is irrelevant. The only important factor that counts is that you are born—cast aside the event that led to your pregnancy or birth. Because you were born, automatically, you are born to fulfill a purpose. You arrived in this world with a divine mandate hanging on your life; you are here to fulfill the purpose of God for your life. However, walking in the purpose of God for your life is not automatic. The purpose of God for your life is a secret treasure that must be discovered. You must discover, understand and fulfill God’s purpose for your life, with eternity in view. Any fulfillment you may have outside the boundary of His purpose for your life is a mirage, fleeting and of no eternal relevance. The authentic joy of fulfillment and accomplishment which receives divine approval is the derivative of walking in the purpose of God for your life.The purpose of this book is to encourage you to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life. You are neither too young nor too old to accomplish it. Perhaps you have wasted several years doing your own thing. You do not need to spend the rest of your life regretting the years you have wasted or not maximized. Rather, build momentum to channel the rest of your life, fulfilling the mandate of God for your life.This title is in volumes.

      "The Apostle Paul wrote: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith” (2 Timothy 4:7). A race is set before you—that race is the purpose you were born to fulfill. This race is not arbitrary; rather, it is specific. And you must finish it. You must fulfill the purpose of God for your life. The Lord only recognizes your fight as a good fight, provided it is the striving to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life. Any effort channeled in the direction that does not converge to the fulfillment of God’s purpose for your life is not the best fight—even if it places a laurel on you and give you accolade among the people. The Lord admonishes you to fight the good fight of faith. You must discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life. You must put your entire weight on this matter. Also, you must receive the heavenly resources that you need to achieve this.This book is written to encourage you to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life, with eternity in view. If you are already living out your purpose, this book is to encourage you to become all you can be and maximize your potential such that you also can say later in life that you have fought the good fight of faith and finished your course. A life well spent is a life that is poured out to God like a drink offering, fulfilling the purpose for which it was created. In case you are yet to discover your purpose, pray to God to show you what your purpose is. Ask Him to create an unquenchable hunger and thirst in you to be completely sold out for Him, discovering, understanding, and fulfilling the purpose for which you were born. This title is in volumes. You are encouraged to read the previous volumes and be on the lookout for subsequent volumes. But note that each volume is a complete book. You do not need to read the previous volumes to understand this volume. Also, this volume does not continue in the subsequent volumes. Secret Treasures For Purpose Fulfillment, Volume Five is a complete book. ",

    description:
      "Until you discover why you are here on earth, you are merely existing. Perhaps you have many plans which determine the trajectory you want your life to follow. Read this Scripture: “Listen well to wise counsel and be willing to learn from correction so that by the end of your life you’ll be known for your wisdom. A person may have many ideas concerning God’s plan for his life, but only the designs of his purpose will succeed in the end.” (Proverbs 19:20-21 TPT, italics mine). Read that Scripture again at least three times. Now read the italicized portion three more times. The purpose of God for your life will eventually win. There are two possible routes to that. First, the purpose of God for your life can win if you surrender yourself to fulfilling His purpose for your life and you channel all your effort towards it—that is the best. Second, the purpose of God will eventually prevail over your life by speaking against you on the Day of Judgement if you choose to do your own thing and did not walk in His purpose for your life—you do not want to be in such a position. The best option is to locate the purpose for which the Lord, your Creator sent you here and walk in it. Whatever you are pursuing outside the divine agenda for your life—the purpose for your creation—is vanity and wastage of your life. You must discover, understand, and fulfill the purpose of God for your life. Are you already trapped in the endless loop of the rat race of life and keeping up with the Joneses? Get out of that loop. According to God’s estimation, whatever you are doing outside the boundary of His mandate for your life is an expensive and unbearable waste of time. Any victory you win going in your way, out of the will of God for your life is at best pyrrhic victory—a victory won with unacceptable losses—losses of irretrievable time you could have spent making supernatural progress in purpose fulfillment. The purpose of this book is to encourage you to discover, understand and fulfill the purpose of God for your life, with eternity in view. It is not too early to do that; neither is it too late. Even if you are in your old age, you can still do as much as you can with the remaining time you have left on earth. ",

    description:
      "Challenges of life show up disproportionately bigger than what they are. They are magnified to give us a false impression that we are in for doom and gloom. They pose as if they are the biggest, toughest, strongest—and above all, insurmountable. They aim at creating disruption, disturbance, distress, and ultimately, destruction. Some people cave in and are crushed by the trials, hardship, and torrents of difficulties. But a few people were able to weather the storms of life and emerged victoriously. What makes the difference? Who and what is magnified amid choking circumstances determine how we will come out at the other end, whether battered and tattered or victorious and glorious.Let The Lord Be Magnified is a step-by-step explanation of Psalm 34:27. Among others, we will learn what it means to 'shout for joy'. Also, we will see various implications of 'Let the Lord be magnified.' God delights in our prosperity. We must magnify Him above whatever we are going through because He is the Creator of all things, and nothing catches Him unaware. We will see from the pages of this book that as we favor His righteous cause and we are bent on magnifying the Lord above the false magnification that challenges pose to us, God will come through for us; the challenges will give way, and we will emerge more-than-conquerors.",

    description:
      "Amid trials, confusions and overwhelming issues of life, God gives urgent attention to a class of prayer: mercy prayer. We desire peace, prosperity and all-round establishment in our lives, homes, families, professions, institutions, ministries and nations. We receive all these on the platform of God’s mercies. Exploring The Multidimensional Mercies Of God is a handbook on God’s mercies. Each chapter is succinctly written to give illumination on a dimension of Gods mercy and to spur up the passion in the reader to pray with the accompanied prayers that end the chapter. This book is divided into three sections. Section 1, What the mercies of God do, describes some benefits we can receive as a result of Gods mercies. Section 2, Grabbing hold of the mercies of God, describes the way Almighty God delights in showing endless mercies and how we can keep the rivers of His mercies continuously flowing in our lives. Sections 3, Be wise with the mercies of God, explains ways we can misuse the mercies of God, and how to be on guard against such things.",
